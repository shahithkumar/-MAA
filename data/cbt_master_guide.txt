# CBT MASTER GUIDE (EXPANDED)

## DOCUMENT: The Cognitive Model (Core Theory)
**Premise**: It is not events that disturb us, but our interpretation of those events.
**The Triad**:
1.  **Situation**: The external event (e.g., You text a friend, they don't reply).
2.  **Automatic Thought**: The instant interpretation (e.g., "They are ignoring me. They hate me.").
3.  **Reaction**:
    *   *Emotional*: Sadness, Anxiety.
    *   *Physiological*: Heavy chest, tears.
    *   *Behavioral*: Sending angry texts or withdrawing.
**The Intervention**: We cannot always control the Situation, but we can catch and change the Automatic Thought. By shifting the thought to "They might be busy," we change the Reaction to "Neutral/Calm."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 1 - All-or-Nothing Thinking
**Definition**: Viewing a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum. Also known as Black-and-White thinking.
**Keywords**: "Always," "Never," "Every," "Total," "Perfect," "Ruined."
**Example**: "I got a B on the test. I'm a total failure." (Ignoring that a B is generally good).
**The Cost**: It creates perfectionism. Since perfection is impossible, you will always feel like a failure.
**Reframe**: "The Grey Scale." Ask yourself to rate the situation on a scale of 0-100. A "B" grade is an 80/100, which is a success, not a 0/100 failure. "Partial success is still success."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 2 - Catastrophizing (Magnification)
**Definition**: Predicting the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes. Blowing things out of proportion.
**Example**: "My throat hurts" -> "It's cancer" -> "I'm going to die alone."
**Example**: "I made a typo" -> "My boss will fire me" -> "I'll lose my house."
**The Mechanism**: The brain tries to protect you by preparing for the worst, but it gets stuck in the worst-case scenario.
**Reframe**: The "Decatastrophizing Script":
1.  What is the Worst Case? (I get fired). Can I survive that? (Yes, I would find another job).
2.  What is the Best Case? (Nobody notices).
3.  What is the **Most Likely** Case? (My boss asks me to fix it).

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 3 - Emotional Reasoning
**Definition**: Thinking that because you *feel* something, it must be true.
**Example**: "I feel guilty, so I must have done something bad."
**Example**: "I feel overwhelmed, so the situation must be impossible."
**The Error**: Emotions are temporary states often caused by fatigue, hunger, or past triggers. They are not objective facts about the current reality.
**Reframe**: "I feel [Emotion], but that doesn't prove [Fact]."
"I feel like a failure, but the facts show I have achieved X, Y, and Z. My feeling is real, but the thought is false."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 4 - Mind Reading
**Definition**: Believing you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other possibilities.
**Example**: "He didn't say hello. He must be angry with me."
**The Error**: You are projecting your own insecurities onto someone else.
**Reframe**: Alternative Explanations.
"List 3 other reasons he didn't say hello: 1. He didn't see me. 2. He was lost in thought. 3. He was having a bad day." Note that none of these involve you.

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 5 - Fortune Telling
**Definition**: Predicting a negative outcome without a realistic basis.
**Example**: "I'm going to freeze up during the presentation, I just know it."
**The Cost**: It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. You get so anxious about freezing that you actually freeze.
**Reframe**: "I cannot predict the future. I have prepared. I might be nervous, but I have handled nervousness before."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 6 - Personalization
**Definition**: Believing that others are behaving negatively because of you, without considering more plausible explanations. Blaming yourself for events outside your control.
**Example**: "My son is failing math; I must be a bad mother."
**Refutation**: "My son's math grade depends on his study habits, the teacher, the curriculum, AND my support. I am only one factor."
**Reframe**: The Pie Chart Technique. Draw a pie chart of responsibility. Assign 20% to yourself, 40% to the son, 40% to the school.

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 7 - Labeling
**Definition**: Assigning a global negative trait to yourself or others.
**Example**: "I made a mistake" -> "I am a *loser*."
**Example**: "He cut me off" -> "He is a *jerk*."
**The Error**: You are confusing a *behavior* (what you did) with your *identity* (who you are). Humans are too complex for one-word labels.
**Reframe**: "I am a person who made a mistake." "He is a driver who drove aggressively just now."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 8 - Should Statements
**Definition**: Having a fixed list of ironclad rules about how you and others should behave.
**Example**: "I should perform well." "People should be nice."
**Result**:
-   Directed at self: Guilt and frustration.
-   Directed at others: Anger and resentment.
**Reframe**: "It would be nice if..." or "I would prefer..."
"I would prefer to perform well, but I accept that I am learning."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 9 - Mental Filter
**Definition**: Dwelling exclusively on the negatives and ignoring the positives.
**Example**: You get 5 compliments and 1 criticism. You obsess over the criticism for days and forget the compliments.
**Metaphor**: A drop of ink in a glass of water. It colors the whole glass.
**Reframe**: "The Double Standard." "If my friend got 5 compliments and 1 criticism, would I tell them they failed? No. I need to look at the whole picture."

## DOCUMENT: Distortion 10 - Overgeneralization
**Definition**: Viewing a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
**Example**: "She turned me down for a date. I will *always* be lonely. *Nobody* wants me."
**Keywords**: "Always," "Everyone," "Nobody," "Everything."
**Reframe**: Be Specific. "She turned me down today. That hurts. But that does not mean every woman on earth will turn me down forever."

## DOCUMENT: Socratic Questioning (Challenging Thoughts)
**Purpose**: A method to systematically dismantle a negative thought.
**Questions**:
1.  What is the evidence that this thought is true?
2.  What is the evidence that this thought is false?
3.  What is an alternative way of looking at this?
4.  What is the worst that could happen? Could I cope?
5.  What is the best that could happen?
6.  If my friend had this thought, what would I tell them?

## DOCUMENT: Behavioral Activation (For Depression)
**Concept**: In depression, we wait to "feel better" before we do things. But motivation follows action, not the other way around.
**The Loop**: Inactivity -> Low Mood -> Lethargy -> Inactivity.
**The Fix**: "Outside-In" change. Do the behavior (e.g., walk, shower) *even if you don't feel like it*. The mood will often improve *after* the action.
**Strategy**: Schedule pleasant or mastery activities. Even small ones like "Wash one dish."

## DOCUMENT: Exposure Therapy Basics (For Anxiety)
**Concept**: Avoidance fuels anxiety. If you avoid the elevator, your brain learns "Elevator = Dangerous."
**Mechanism**: Habituation. By staying in the feared situation, your anxiety will eventually peak and then naturally drop. You learn you can survive it.
**Strategy (Laddering)**:
1.  Look at a photo of an elevator.
2.  Stand near an elevator.
3.  Step in and step out.
4.  Ride one floor.
5.  Ride to the top.

## DOCUMENT: The Control Fallacy
**Definition**:
1.  **Fallacy of Internal Control**: Thinking you are responsible for everything (leads to guilt).
2.  **Fallacy of External Control**: Thinking you are a helpless victim of fate (leads to hopelessness).
**The Serenity Prayer Approach**: Distinguish clearly between what you can control (your effort, your reaction) and what you cannot (results, others' opinions, the past).
**Reframe**: "I control the input, not the outcome."

## DOCUMENT: The Just-World Fallacy
**Definition**: Believing that in a just world, good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.
**Result**: When something bad happens to you, you assume "I must have done something to deserve this," or "It's unfair!" which leads to bitterness.
**Reality**: Bad things happen randomly. It is not a moral judgment on you.
**Reframe**: Radical Acceptance. "This situation sucks. It is not fair. But it is happening, and I must deal with it as it is."
